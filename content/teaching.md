# Tutoring

## Supplemental Instruction, UCSD
I served as a SI Leader and Course Leader helping students better understand curriculum and course material through facilitation and scaffolded instruction. This included attending lectures, taking notes, and creating 80-minute session plans weekly that were relevant to the current course topic. As a leader, I facilitated two sessions per week, assisted students in lecture, and answered student questions. As a course leader, I supervised other leaders by providing guidance on session plans, observing their sessions and providing feedback for improvement. I also planned weekly team meetings for training and community building.

# Teaching

## Teaching Assistant
I am currently a teaching assistant for Earth 7 - Dinosaurs at UCSB. This includes running three lab sections a week, where I present content and slides and answer student questions. This also includes grading their exams, running weekly office hours, and proctoring student exams.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tutoring&#34;&gt;Tutoring&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;supplemental-instruction-ucsd&#34;&gt;Supplemental Instruction, UCSD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I served as a SI Leader and Course Leader helping students better understand curriculum and course material through facilitation and scaffolded instruction. This included attending lectures, taking notes, and creating 80-minute session plans weekly that were relevant to the current course topic. As a leader, I facilitated two sessions per week, assisted students in lecture, and answered student questions. As a course leader, I supervised other leaders by providing guidance on session plans, observing their sessions and providing feedback for improvement. I also planned weekly team meetings for training and community building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
